# Meta-Language-
SML stuff

I will be implementing (to learn SML ie Standard Meta-Language) SML snippets initially from 
the lecture notes and videos of University of Washington online course on functional programming.

I am using the SMLNJ compiler and using emacs for the first time in 2018.

I will use these notes to maybe refer back to, in the future; for re-learning, nostaligia or measuring progress.
